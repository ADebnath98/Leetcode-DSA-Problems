Intuition
The problem is asking us to determine whether Player 1 can win the game of selecting elements from either end of the array optimally. To achieve the highest score difference between Player 1 and Player 2, we need to calculate the maximum score difference for different subarrays of the given array. The problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming with a single-dimensional array.

Approach
We use a single-dimensional dynamic programming approach with memoization to calculate the maximum score difference for each subarray. We create a vector dp, where the index represents the starting index of the subarray, and store the maximum score difference for each subarray in this vector.

We start by iterating through the array in reverse, from the last element to the first element. For each index i, we set the corresponding dp[i] value to the element itself, as it represents the base case for subarrays with only one element.

Then, we use another loop to iterate from i + 1 to the last element. Inside this loop, we update the value of dp[j] for each j using the maximum score difference between two choices: either selecting the leftmost element nums[i] or the rightmost element nums[j]. We update dp[j] based on these two choices, representing Player 1's turn in each case.

After completing both loops, the value of dp[n - 1] represents the maximum score difference for the entire array (from index 0 to index n - 1). If this value is greater than or equal to 0, it means Player 1 can win the game optimally.

        vector<int> dp(n, 0);

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            dp[i] = nums[i];
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                dp[j] = max(nums[i] - dp[j], nums[j] - dp[j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[n - 1] >= 0;
    }
